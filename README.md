# Google Search Books

* This Application is a MERN-based Google Books Search application.

* Users can search for books via the Google Books API and render them.
  Users have the option to "View" a book, bringing them to the book on Google Books,
  or "Save" a book, saving it to the Mongo database.
 
* Users can also see all books saved to the Mongo database. Users have an option to
  "View" the book, bringing them to the book on Google Books, or "Delete" a book,
  removing it from the Mongo database.

* This project was a perfect way for me to learn how to create a MERN
  (MongoDB-Express-React-Node) Application.

* To get started, clone the repository and check out the code.

* To just run the application, use link https://rocky-reef-39998.herokuapp.com/

* Enjoy :)
